## 🗂️ Projects

### 🎮 `falling-rocks`
> A simple side-to-side dodge game using 2D arrays and real-time keypresses. Boulders fall from above — avoid them or get roasted.

- Tech: Python, terminal
- Status: Playable prototype

---

### 📱 `falling-rocks-android`  
> 📌 **Not included in this repo — lives in its own GitHub repo.**

---

### 🎨 `pixelart-editor`
> A 32x32 pixel art editor with a 16-color palette, random sprite generator, and export-to-PNG. You can draw, resize the grid, and save your creations.

- Tech: Python, Tkinter, Pillow
- Bonus: Includes symmetry, AI-inspired pattern generation

---

### 🧠 `lhopital`
> GUI calculator that demonstrates L’Hôpital’s Rule with explanations, symbolic steps, and random indeterminate examples.

- Tech: Python, Tkinter, SymPy
- Features: Random expressions, explanations, limit breakdown

---

### 🔥 `mandelbrot`
> Generates and visualizes fractals like the Mandelbrot Set with interactive controls (slider for zoom and shifting).

- Tech: Python, Tkinter, PIL
- Purpose: Learn recursive geometry & visualization

---

### 🇺🇸 `flag-waving`
> Animated ASCII American flag “waving in the wind” using color and motion in a GUI canvas.

- Tech: Python, Tkinter, Colorama
- Just for fun

---

### 🧪 Other Included Experiments:
- `calculator/`: simple math app
- `data-splitter/`, `datamanip/`, `datamine/`: utilities for slicing or analyzing data
- `html/`: browser-based experiments (Mario game, portfolio site)
- `fakedata/`: desktop app for generating fake datasets

---

## 🛠 Requirements

Most projects use:

```bash
pip install pillow sympy colorama
